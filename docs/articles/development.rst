Examples
--------

The ``docs/examples`` dirctory contains the examples of ``argparse_action``.
Every exmaple has its own subdirectory which contains a ``main.py`` and some
example call: ``call``, ``help``...

Build
.....

The :ref:`Tutorial` is generated by ``docs/examples/build.py``. ``build.py``
creates separated section for every example in the Tutorial. The title of the
section is generated from the docstring of the ``main.py``. The name of the
example directory is not used in the documentation. Only the order of the
sections are depending on the name of the exmaple directories.

Test
....

The examples are tested by ``tests/test_exmaples.py``. ``test_exmaples.py``
executes the first line of the example calls as a shell command and check
the rest of the file with the sdtout of the shell call.

Every example calls are tested and included into the documentation.

New features
............

New features of ``argparse_action`` should be demonstrated with an example and
at least two example calls e.g.:call and help.

Release
-------

The version of a release should follow the practice of semantive versioning.
A separated patch should be created for the new release were only the version
is bumped. This patch should be tagged and the tag should be the version number.

The new release should be published on `pypi <https://pypi.org>`_ and the
documentation should be updated on `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.
